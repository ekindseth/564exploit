# 564exploit
Evan and Stefans project

Hi, welcome to our 564 exploit. We decided to leverage an exploit in an enterprise messaging app called Inbit Messenger. It is vulnerable to a bufferoverflow that allowed for remote code execution.
Here is a link to the exploit on exploit-DB: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51126

# Scenario
So, to set the scene, we decided to target a ski resort season pass holder database. In order to ski at many major resorts, there is an RFID gate system at each ski lift which allows 
season pass holders to scan their RFID cards and then proceed to the lift. Our cyber effect can access the database of these season pass holders, and add and remove users. 

# Initial setup 
We wrote a wrapper script called master.py which calls the exploit script with our initial payload. The initial payload downloads the implant onto the victim computer and then runs it. Once the implant is downloaded and running, it will constantly be listening for TCP connections on port 12000. We can then connect to it by running our command and control (C2) python script with the target IP and port as parameter.
